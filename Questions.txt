Question 1:
Bubs wants you to track information on his customers(first name, last name, email), his employees
(first name, last name, start date, position held), his products, and the prurchases customers make(
which customer, when it was purchased, for how much money). Think about how many tables you should create.
Which data goes in which tables? How should the tables relate to one another?
*/

/*
Question 2:
Given the database design you came up with, use Workbenct to create an EER diagram of database.
Include things like primary keys and foreign keys, and anything you thing you should have in the
tables. Make sure to use reasonable data types for each column.
*/

/*
Question 3:
Create a schema called bubsbooties.Within that schema, create the table that
you have diagramed out. Make sure they relate to each other, and that have
the same reasonable data types you selected previously.
*/

/*
Question 4:
Add any constrains you think your tables' columns should have. Think through which columns needs to be
unique, which ones are allowed to have NULL values, etc.
*/

/*
Question 5:
Insert at least 3 records of data into each table. The exact values do not matter, so feel free to make them
up. Just make sure that the data you insert makes sense, and that the tables tie together.
*/

/*
Question 6:
Create two users and give them access to the database. The first user,TuckerReilly, will be the DBA, and should
get full database administrator privileges. The second user, EllaBrody, is an Analyst, and only needs read access.
